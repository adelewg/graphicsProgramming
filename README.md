**Vectors**.     
Vectors will help us to keep the code tidy and neat.   
A vector is like a set of instructions to get from one point to another.   
A vector has both direction and magnitude.    
.add()      
.sub().   
.mult().   
.div().   
There is also another technique called static addition where you can add two vectos together without changing them. An example of this would be: v3 = p5.Vector.add( v1, v2 )     
v1 and v2 remain unchanged and we store the result of the addition in a new vector called v3.
